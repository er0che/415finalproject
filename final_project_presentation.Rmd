## My project aims to

- analyze the different language used to tweet about popular music artists
- see where tweets about artists are geographically located

## Tweet Locations
- tweet maps turned out pretty much the same
- this is likely due to widespread national reach of each artist

## Rihanna Tweet Map

## Taylor Swift Tweet Map

```{r include = FALSE}
library(streamR)
source("sentiment.R")
```

## Top Words By Artist
```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(head(rihannacount), caption = "Top Words in Tweets About Rihanna")
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(head(tswiftcount), caption = "Top Words in Tweets About Taylor Swift")
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(head(jbiebercount), caption = "Top Words in Tweets About Justin Bieber")
```

---

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(head(kendrickcount), caption = "Top Words in Tweets About Kendrick Lamar")
```

## Sentiments overall
- Rihanna, Taylor, and Kendrick had more negative words than positive
- Justin had more positive than negative
- A larger scale study could tell us if this is due to gender, race, or some other factor

---

```{r}
grid.arrange(rihannaplot1, tswiftplot1, jbieberplot1, klamarplot1, ncol=2)
```

## Sentiments by tweet
- Justin seems to have the most neutral tweets
- negative tweets seem to be more strongly negative than positive tweets are strongly positive

```{r}
grid.arrange(rihannaplot2, tswiftplot2, jbieberplot2, klamarplot2, ncol=2)
```

## Word Frequency by Artist App
